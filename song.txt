Don't ever let them use you
They will bring you to your knees
I'll try to lead you for awhile
But every time I talk to you
You're too afraid to see
Open your eyes
(Breathe in life)
Open your eyes
(Breathe in, breathe out)
Oh I, I can see the light
Stay with me
Away from the darkest of nights
Stay with me
Stay with me
(Stay with me)
Stay with me
Oh, stay with me
(Stay with me)
Stay with me
I don't know if you're ready
You should see where I have been
I don't know if you're ready
And I don't know where to begin
Open your eyes
(Breathe in life)
Open your eyes
(Breathe in, breathe out)
Oh I, I can see the light
Stay with me
Away from the darkest of nights
Stay with me
Stay with me
(Stay with me)
Stay with me
Oh, stay with me
(Stay with me)
Stay with me
I, I can see the light
Stay with me
Away from the darkest of nights
Stay with me
Stay with me
(Stay with me)
Stay with me
(Stay with me)
Oh, stay with me
(Stay with me)
Stay with me
Oh, stay with me
(Stay with me)
Stay with me
(Stay with me)
Oh, stay with me
(Stay with me)
Stay with me
Oh, stay with
Oh, stay with me
Oh, stay with
